## 📆 Week of July 21–27, 2025

### ✅ What I Learned
- Refreshed key Java concepts including functional interfaces, concurrency tools, and exception handling.
- Reviewed Spring Boot auto-configuration mechanisms and conditional bean loading.

### 🔧 What I Built / Solved
- Generated SSH keys and set up GitLab access successfully.

### ⚠️ Roadblocks
- Still exploring stable Kafka configurations for event-driven modules.

### 🚀 Goals for Next Week
- Dive deeper into Redis caching strategies and Kafka consumers.
- Set up local testing with Docker Compose for PostgreSQL and Redis.

### ✍️ Personal Reflection
> This week felt like a bridge between refinement and exploration. Clarifying the fundamentals reminded me how far I’ve come, and getting closer to scalable deployment setups brings me a step nearer to building truly resilient systems.
