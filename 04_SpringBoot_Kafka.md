## üß∞ Spring Boot Fundamentals

### üõ† Key Annotations

| Annotation                  | Purpose                                                   |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| `@SpringBootApplication`   | Combines `@Configuration`, `@EnableAutoConfiguration`, and `@ComponentScan` |
| `@RestController`          | Returns data directly from controller methods             |
| `@RequestMapping`          | Maps HTTP requests to handler methods                     |
| `@Autowired`               | Injects Spring-managed beans                              |
| `@Value("${property}")`    | Injects values from `application.properties`              |

### ‚öôÔ∏è Auto-Configuration Deep Dive
- Triggers on presence of classes/resources in the classpath
- Controlled by `@ConditionalOnClass`, `@ConditionalOnMissingBean`, etc.
- Key mechanism: `spring.factories` file in `META-INF` directory

---

## üåø Spring Profiles & Property Config

```properties
spring.profiles.active=dev
server.port=9090
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/mydb
logging.level.org.springframework.web=DEBUG
```

Use `@Profile("dev")` on beans to isolate environment-specific configurations.

## üí¨ Kafka in Spring Boot

### üîÑ Producer Setup

```java
@Autowired
private KafkaTemplate<String, String> kafkaTemplate;

public void sendMessage(String message) {
    kafkaTemplate.send("myTopic", message);
}
```

### üì• Consumer Setup

```java
@KafkaListener(topics = "myTopic", groupId = "backend-group")
public void listen(String msg) {
    System.out.println("Received: " + msg);
}
```

### üì¶ application.yaml Example

```yaml
spring:
  kafka:
    bootstrap-servers: localhost:9092
    producer:
      key-serializer: org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringSerializer
      value-serializer: org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringSerializer
    consumer:
      group-id: backend-group
      auto-offset-reset: earliest
      key-deserializer: org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringDeserializer
      value-deserializer: org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringDeserializer
```

| Concept            | Explanation                                                   |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| Partitions         | Enable parallelism and scalability                           |
| Consumer Group     | Multiple consumers load-balance reading from partitions      |
| Offset Management  | Tracks read position per partition per consumer              |
| Acknowledgement    | `acks=0/1/all` determine delivery guarantees                  |
| Durability         | Achieved via replication factor + min.insync.replicas        |
| Ordering           | Guaranteed within a partition                                |
| Retention          | Configurable topic data lifetime (e.g., 7 days default)       |

### üîÅ Comparison Table

| Feature        | Kafka                   | RabbitMQ               | Redis Streams          |
|----------------|--------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| Messaging Model| Pub/Sub & Queues         | Queues & Exchanges     | Stream-like Lists      |
| Durability     | High (log-based)         | Moderate               | Dependent on setup     |
| Ordering       | Per-partition            | FIFO or manual config  | Preserved per stream   |

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Error Handling Best Practices

- Use `SeekToCurrentErrorHandler` for retries in Kafka consumers
- Configure dead letter topics for failed message delivery
- Monitor using Spring Actuator + Prometheus/Grafana
- Validate schema compatibility using Avro + Schema Registry

---

## üöÄ Production Readiness Tips

- Use `@KafkaListener(id = "customId", containerFactory = "customFactory")` for fine-tuned listeners
- Externalize Kafka configurations into `.properties` or `.yaml` files
- Enable batch processing for high throughput
- Monitor lag using Kafka Exporter or Cruise Control

Here's a solid draft for a section on **Advanced Patterns** in distributed systems and event-driven architectures, specifically focusing on **Saga**, **Kafka Streams**, and **Spring Cloud Stream**.

---

## üîÅ Advanced Patterns for Distributed Systems

As systems evolve to support distributed architectures and microservices, managing consistency, communication, and state becomes increasingly complex. The following advanced patterns and technologies help address these challenges by enabling **resilience**, **scalability**, and **asynchronous communication**.

---

### üß© Saga Pattern

The **Saga Pattern** is a design pattern for managing data consistency across microservices in distributed transactions, without needing distributed locks.

#### How It Works:

* A saga is a sequence of local transactions.
* Each service performs its transaction and publishes an event.
* Subsequent services listen and react accordingly.
* If a step fails, compensating transactions are triggered to undo the previous steps.

#### Two Common Approaches:

1. **Choreography**: Services listen to events and react, no central coordinator.
2. **Orchestration**: A central orchestrator coordinates the saga steps explicitly.

#### Benefits:

* Avoids distributed transactions.
* Works well with eventual consistency.
* Improves system resilience.

#### Tools:

* [Axon Framework](https://axoniq.io/)
* [Eventuate Tram/Saga](https://eventuate.io/)
* Spring Boot with event messaging

---

### üîÄ Kafka Streams

**Kafka Streams** is a client library for building real-time, stream-processing applications on top of Apache Kafka.

#### Key Concepts:

* **KStream**: Represents a stream of records.
* **KTable**: Represents a changelog stream (like a table view).
* **Stateful processing**: Supports joins, aggregations, windowing.
* **Exactly-once processing**: Achievable with proper Kafka configuration.

#### Use Cases:

* Real-time analytics and dashboards
* Monitoring and anomaly detection
* ETL pipelines
* Materialized views in microservices

#### Benefits:

* Embedded in applications (no external cluster needed).
* High fault tolerance and scalability.
* Integrates tightly with Kafka topics.

---

### üåä Spring Cloud Stream

**Spring Cloud Stream** is a framework for building message-driven microservices using Spring Boot and binder abstractions over messaging middleware like Kafka and RabbitMQ.

#### Key Features:

* Declarative bindings (`@EnableBinding`, `@StreamListener`, `@Input`, `@Output`)
* Schema evolution and message conversion
* Integration with Spring Boot ecosystems
* Functional programming model (`Consumer`, `Supplier`, `Function` beans)

#### Example:

```java
@Bean
public Function<String, String> uppercase() {
    return value -> value.toUpperCase();
}
```

#### Why Use It?

* Simplifies integration with messaging platforms.
* Enables reactive, decoupled service communication.
* Supports multiple binders and dynamic configuration.

#### Common Use Cases:

* Event-driven microservices
* Log and metric ingestion pipelines
* Decoupled orchestration of business workflows

---

### üîó Combining These Patterns

These technologies and patterns often work **together**:

* Use **Spring Cloud Stream** to build reactive services that consume and publish Kafka events.
* Implement **Saga Pattern** using Kafka topics to coordinate long-running business transactions.
* Employ **Kafka Streams** for transforming and enriching the event data as it flows through your system.
